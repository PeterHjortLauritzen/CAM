IMPORTANT NOTES

- frictional heating in sponge (with increased sponge layer damping)
  drove temperature over 1000K; turned off del2 frictional heating
- also turned off frictional heating for del4 (otherwise get max
  temps of 1000K+)

- trial and error stable time-stepping:

    se_nsplit = 12
    se_rsplit = 1
    se_hypervis_subcycle           = 3
    se_hypervis_subcycle_q         = 1
